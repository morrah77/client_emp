Create a program that allows user to see the employee records.

The program will make a call to http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees to fetch the employee details.

User should be able to run the program and see a list of all the employees, with an additional option of specifying the employee id
to see specific employee details

Requirements for the program:

-    User must be able to interact with it.

-    The program/executable must be standalone.

-    A set of easy to follow instructions on how to run and execute the program must be provided. Assume the system used for running the program has just a base OS installed.

To be submitted:

-  Your instructions

-  All of the source code and the corresponding executable must be provided via git hub (ideally) or as a zip file

-  Unit tests for your application.

-  Appropriate error handling
